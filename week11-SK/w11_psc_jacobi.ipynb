    "## Week 11-PSC-the introduction of Jacobi Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this PSC you are going to develop a solver for the system\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Ax = b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "that is, given a $n \\times n$ matrix A and a right-hand-side (RHS) vector $b$, of size $n$. you need to compute the solution vector $x$ (which is also of size $n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "From class you will know that computing the inverse of $A$ and multiplying against $b$ gives you this solution. That is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = A^{-1}b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a direct method, but sometimes the inverse of $A$ is very difficult to find, sometimes it is impossible to compute, so we have developed alternative routes to solving the system without creating the inverse itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative methods are typically used to solve these systems. In these we start with an approximation to $x$, and perform some operation to generate a new vector $x^{new}$ that is a bit closer to the true solution. You repeat the operation with the new vector and it gives you another vector that is again a bit closer to the true solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do this enough times, the approximation will converge to the true solution. When you are close enough, you simply stop the iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a massive class of iterative solvers out there. We will develop the simplest one called the Jacobi method.The recipe is as follows:\n",

    "For the system of size $n \\times n$\n",

    "$$Ax = b$$\n",

    "start with some approximation $x$. The Jacobi iteration creates a new vector $x^{1}$ by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "loop over each element of $x_i$ for $i = \\{ 1,2,3, \\ldots n \\}$, and compute the new value by:\n",
    "\n",
