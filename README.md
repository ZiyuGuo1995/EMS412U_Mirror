# Teaching materials of EMS412U for QMUL 1st year Engineering Students
## Module Name: Computational and Mathematical Modelling: statics
## Module Orgainsers: Wei Tan, Rehan Shah, Sergey Karabasov

## Module Description

This module provide students with knowledge of mathematical and computing techniques that are essential for Engineering students. Topics covered are basic logic and methods of proofs, sequences and series, limits, differentiation and integration and partial derivatives. Students will develop to command prompt applications of the numerical and symbolic toolboxes of Python. The mathematical and computational techniques will be developed through the introduction of the fundamental principles of statics for linearly elastic materials and their application to  structures.  It focuses on the behaviour of structures in particular beams and shafts, and provides underpinning knowledge for a range of analyses on applications relevant to engineering.

## Aims

The module proposal results from a review of the Undergraduate Engineering programmes in the School of Engineering and Materials Science.  It forms a compulsory module for all  Engineering and Materials (except Design, Innovation and Creative Engineering) programmes in the School.  It introduces basic mathematical techniques and associated computing skills using Python that are required to solve problems whilst introducing students to the concepts in statics and the ability to solve interesting , real-life problems with Python.

## Objectives

- To provide students with knowledge of basic mathematical and computational techniques that are essential for Engineering students.

- To introduce students to tools used for the static analysis of objects and structures.

- To enable students to analyse the stresses developed in simple static situations and develop quantitative models in applications relevant to Engineering.

- To provide students with the capacity to appropriately approximate from a real life situation to a simple model that can be analysed.

## Learning contents

The python teaching materials are delivered via the **Jupyterhub** server, all the students can have access to their own workspace, go through the learning materials and edit the codes. We have teaching assistants to help the students during the Python IT lab sessions. 

1. Week 1 - Week 4: Python basics covering print statement, if statements, loops, Creating and using functions, nesting loops and if statements, Using python libraries
2. Week 5 - Week 9: Python to solve Engineering mechanics problems, covering calculate the resultant force and moment, 1st and 2nd moment of area, plot stress-strain curves, plot internal shear force and moment diagram, numerical integration and numerical differentiation. 
3. Week 10 - Week 12: Python to solve matrix algebra, covering matrix operations, eigenvalue and eigenvectors. 

Note that week 7 is a reading week that all students are revising their learning materials, so there are no teaching contents for week 7. 

In addition to the python teaching materials, we still have the traditional lecture sessions and problem solving tutorials. This is complemented by 

- Pre-recorded videos (not available for the public);
- Lecture notes (not available for the public);
- Problem solving sheets (not available for the public);
- Python-based teaching materials in Jupyter notebook files: current available in the Github repository.

## Python test (25% of the module)
We are using the **nbgrader** for the python test, it can mark the python scripts from students automatically. Check it out if you want use this tool: https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
